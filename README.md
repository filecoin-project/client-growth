# Filecoin Client Growth

## Introduction
This repo is aimed at consolidating efforts toward enabling client growth on the Filecoin network. The growth of this working group is to accelerate client acquisition by enabling smooth processes and building the necessary tools.

It serves as a place where the community can collect issues and requests on:
 - Data Ingestion - the infrastructure necessary to help clients onboard data as seamlessly as possible.
 - User Research - efforts to get feedback on client data onboarding (problems with tooling).
 - Data Analytics - analytics tooling for monitoring the progress around client growth.
 - Product Operations - managing OKRs and goals that support the efforts above.
